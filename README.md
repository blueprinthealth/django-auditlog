django-auditlog
================

A tool/example for django auditing (model change tracking).
Partially based on https://github.com/Atomidata/django-audit-log

It is not working in all cases in it's current state, and is a work in progress.
Currently not production ready or fully tested. I'm not sure how it handles load, 
or what kind of load it imposes. Feel free to use any or all of it.

There is currently no GUI for it.
